A few days ago, I was at pycon2023 in Coimbra, Portugal (By the way, it seemed a great place to have a holiday in).
The first talk was called optimizing for joy by [credits here]. In this presentation (which I would like to disposal).
He talked about a side project that motivates him to to learn a bunch of technologies, and as a outcome he was finding
all hardcoded credentials that were uploaded to python package manager.

Besides of his work, which by the way was very interesting how he used github CI to process a bunch of data without 
having to renting a server. One thing sticked in mind: OUTCOME. When we are beginners its easy to get excited at the
minimum outcome. (I can even remember the excitement that I had when I ran my first hello world in C). It was awesome.
As the time passes by and we become more mature, we kinda of lose that excitment about learning something new.

After the talk I we chat a little bit, I remember telling him that I couldn't find joy on study the things that I
know that I need to. I recognize that some people really like to build things just because they can, that's fine 
but I don't have any joy doing so. And he suggested me that I could do side projects and basically try to pretend
that is a real project, or maybe that I could build tools that I really need for my work. After think a while about it
I realized that none of these approaches would suit me.

First things first, Personally I find excitement in discovering how a business work, what are the business rules,
what are the things underlying it, how things need to be structured so that this business could operate. I will
give an example and I will hope that it makes it clear. I've never worked in a e-commerce platform before, I could easily
create a clone of amazon, with shopping cart, favorites and stuff like that, of course. But the most important thing is
what makes an e-commerce an e-commerce? how shipping is made? how the loggistics of transportation works? what are the
backoffice systems and how they are structured so I caould easliy see the whereabouts of my package? See... This is 
the part of the developer career, that really engages me.

And how about developing the tools that I could use on my Work? For this I have one of the most famous xkcd notes
on the first page of my notepad:

[how much time to you spend in a task before make it]

Basically, I think that every tool that I could possibly imagine to speedup my, I'm most certain that I someone has 
already did it, and probably even better implementations than me.

I had been thinking about being a actively open-source contributor. I'm right that my code will have a purpose, and be
useful to someone else, but I really think that cup of tea is business and constraints, when I look the constraints 
of a solution that someone has asked me to build, I feel engaged into doing it, for me that's a challenge, a puzzle
that I need to solve and give a OUTCOME. Oops... here's the outcome again. At this point you could imagine that
this is the same reason that I don't find whatever coding challenge platform exciting.

And then something clicked on my head, maybe the outcome don't need to be a product specifically speaking, but I could
find another things that bring me joy and I could use as a trigger to become a better developer. While I'm typing this
article I'm thinking... I enjoy write about things, and more exactly write cronicles. With this mindset I will start 
a blog, and I'll wirte about software development, carreer, always giving my thoughts about it. I don't know exactly
if this will work, and I'll got more joy experimenting things to bring my opinions. But I think that worth trying.

My last piece of advice is: try to at least read the presentation of [guy] on pycon2023. 

I hope that I'll see you all soon....
